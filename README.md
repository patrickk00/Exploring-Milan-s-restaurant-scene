Abstract


Our project is related to restaurant data retrieval, integration,
exploratory analysis, sentiment analysis and the development of a
recommendation system. The primary goal was to collect information
from TripAdvisor and Google related to restaurants in Milan using web
scraping techniques and api. The gathered data was then cleaned,
integrated, cleaned again and subjected to exploratory analysis to gain
valuable insights into the restaurant landscape in Milan.
We aim to reply to the following research questions:
1. How eective is sentiment analysis in understanding feelings towards
restaurants in Milan based on comments retrieved from restaurants
customers?
2. What are the insights gained from the exploratory analysis of restaurant data
in Milan, and how do these insights contribute to understanding the
restaurant landscape in the city?
3. How used techniques are powerful and eective in order to use the retrieved
data to perform reliable analysis?
